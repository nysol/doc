\subsection{bufcount= Buffer size\label{sect:option_bufcount}}

Specify the internal buffer size (number of blocks) to be used in commands such as mbucket, mnjoin, and mshare, for processing key units at which data requires multiple pass scanning. 
One buffer block contains 4MB, the default size is 10 blocks (40MB).
In case of buffer overflow, data is written to a temporary file. If the key size is very large, the processing speed can be improved by adjusting this parameter if memory permits.
