\subsubsection*{Example 1: Basic Example}

The exponential notation of id=1 is 1.2345678e +08, the exponent bits is more than 6 significant figures when the significant figures of mantissa is set at 6.   
The exponential notation of id=2 is 1.23456789e +03, the exponent bits is more than 7 significant figures when the significant figures of integer bits + decimal bits is set at 6. 
The exponential notation of id=4 is 1.23456789e-04, the exponent bits is less than -4 when the significant figures is set at 6. 
The exponential notation of id=5 is 1.23456789e-05, the exponent bits is less than -4 when the significant figures of mantissa is set at 6.
