\section{ceil - Ceiling\label{sect:ceil}}
\index{ceil@ceil}

Format: ceil($num$,base)

Round up $num$ based on multiples of the base number, and returns the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to $num$. 

For example, given ceil(3.42,05), the numerical value will be rounded up by scales of 0.5 that is greater than 3.42. Thus, the rounded number at base 0.5 becomes 3.5. When base is not specified as an argument, the default base is set at 1. 
This is equivalent to rounding up to the nearest integer after the decimal.
