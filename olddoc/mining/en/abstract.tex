Data mining is the initial process in knowledge discovery to discover meaningful patterns from large data sets by applying data analysis technique such as statistics, pattern recognition, and artificial intelligence. 
Examples of data mining techniques includes extraction of association rules in "enumeration of frequent patterns", predict data category with the use of "classification", prediction of real value using "regression analysis", and classification of similar data with "clustering".
This set data mining commands allow users to apply the mentioned approach in data analysis. In addition, a Ruby extension library is provided for processing of large-scale CSV data in Ruby, which reads input data in CSV format as it is done in MCMD.
