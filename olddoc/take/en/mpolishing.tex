Data polishing algorithm can be applied to general graph data to remove noise, and generate "polished graph" to increase distinction of graph.  
In order to illustrate the effect of polishing, Figure \ref{fig:polish0} and Figure \ref{fig:polish1} shows the graphs before and after polishing respectively.   
In the original graph, the dense structure is polished to enhance the density, while the sparse structure is thinned out. 
As a result, many medium-sized maximal cliques (other complete subgraph that does not exists exclusively in complete subgraph) are generated.

The polishing algorithm is shown in Algorithm \ref{algo:polish}. 
The algorithm shown below  is not the most efficient but the mechanics shows how it works. 
Please refer to \cite{Uno2014} for  detailed reference on the algorithm which was implemented in the command.  
Polishing is based on a simple methodology by  connecting all pairs of nodes (vertices) if the degree of similarity is more than or equal to threshold specified by user, otherwise, a new graph will be created from rules that were not connected. 


\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Graph polishing algorithm \label{algo:polish}}
\begin{small}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Function{Polishing}{$G=(V,E),\sigma$}
	\State $V:Vertex set, E:Edge set, \sigma: Lower limit of similarity$
	\State $E'=\phi$; $V'=\phi$ \Comment Initialization of edge set and vertex set after polishing
	\ForAll{$u\in V$}
		\ForAll{$v\in V$} \Comment \# Search for all vertex pair $u,v$
			\If{$sim(u,v)\ge\sigma$} \Comment If the vertices pair $u,v$ are similar, add a new edge, otherwise, do not add 
				\State $E'=E'\cup (u,v)$
				\State $V'=V'\cup u$
				\State $V'=V'\cup v$
			\EndIf
		\EndFor
	\EndFor
	\State {\bf return}{$(V',E')$}
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}
\end{small}
\end{algorithm}

The same polishing procedure is repeatedly applied to newly constructed graph until there are no more changes to the graph structure, or when the number of iterations reaches the maximum value specified by user. The final graph obtained is the polished graph.  

The definition of similarity between two nodes (Refer to line 6 of Algorithm \ref{algo:polish}:$sim(u,v)$) is shown. Basically, let's consider "Friends who have a lot of common friends".   
Figure \ref{fig:sim} shows the structure where the nodes in the middle are  connected to nodes $u,v$.
 Even though $u$ and $v$ are not directly connected, among the 5 connected nodes, nodes 3,4 have 2 common nodes connected.   
 This information is used to define degree of similarity.

\end{figure}

There are 6 types of similarity measures which can be applied in this command as shown in \ref{tbl:simdef}. The desired similarity measure can be defined at the \verb|sim=| parameter,  and the lower limit of degree of similarity can be specified at \verb|th=| parameter.

\subsection{Examples}
Input data of general graph for this command is shown in Table \ref{tbl:input}, edge data and node pair is expressed in CSV format. 
The graph is processed as undirected graph, with multiple islands. 
Single node which does not have an edge is not subjected to polishing (no friend), and the node data is not used as input. Data shown in Table \ref{tbl:input} is visualised as graph format in Figure \ref{fig:inputg}. 
Example of data polishing using the sample data is shown below. 

\vspace{1em}

\begin{table}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\caption{Input Data (Edge data)\label{tbl:input}}
\begin{tabular}{cc}

a&c\\
a&e\\

\end{table} 

For simplicity, similarity is defined as intersection with a lower limit of 2. 
In other words, when the adjacent nodes has 2 or more common nodes, extend the edge, and  vice versa. 
For example, Figure \ref{fig:ad}, Figure \ref{fig:inputg} is a subgraph extracted of which are connected with nodes $a,b$.  
Having the 2 nodes $e,c$ in common, the edge of node $a,b$  is extended in the polished graph. 
 While the common node for $e,g$(Figure \ref{fig:eg}) is only $b$, the edge is not extended in the polished graph.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:ab2} shows a subgraph related to node $a,b$. The difference from the past 2 examples is that nodes $a,b$ are directly connected. In this case, there are two consideration. 
First, in Figure \ref{fig:ab1}, without considering direct relationship, only take into account common relationships with friends. 
The other method assumes nodes $a,b$ have common friends, fictitious node $a',b'$ is added, and it is assumed that both $a,b$ are connected as shown in Figure \ref{fig:ab3}. 
Therefore, if there is a direct connection, there will only be two people as common friends. 


\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}

\begin{minipage}{0.3\hsize}

\caption{Example with direct connection\label{fig:ab3}}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


When updating new connection relationship for all nodes pairs as described above, the polished graph excluding direct relationship is shown in Figure \ref{fig:polished0}, and the polished graph with direct relationship is shown in Figure \ref{fig:polished2}. When the newly graphs are repeatedly polished and the graph structure did not change (converge) for 3 times, Figure \ref{fig:polished1} and Figure\ref{fig:polished3} are obtained. 
When direct connection is not considered, all relationship connections are removed. On the other hand, if direct connect is considered, the six nodes $a,b,c,d,e,g$ are connected to each other and maximal cliques are created. 
However, node $f$ is still connected with $e$, which also forms maximal cliques $e,f$.  Finally, when data polishing is repeated applied, the graph structure will gradually be stabilized. However, in some cases, the structure does not converge.

Similarity in simple terms, can be defined as the  number of edges in common for data polishing. However, as the size of the graph increases, there are more cases where the edges cannot be polished. As the number of adjacent nodes increases, the number of nodes become huge, even when edges are extended for nodes pairs sharing common nodes, the relationship is relatively weak.  

Therefore, by applying resemblance, the degree of similarity can be used to evaluate relative common similarity measure. When resemblance is used as similarity measure,  graphs that are polished until convergence at lower limit at 0.4 and 0.5 is shown in Figure \ref{fig:resemblance04} and \ref{fig:resemblance05}.

Figure \ref{fig:pmi02} is a result of applying normalized PMI as degree of similarity, with a lower limit of 0.2.

Other than the polished graph, various operation statistics can be returned in the output as shown in Table \ref{tbl:stat} (File specified at \verb|log=|).

The characteristics of data polishing is summarized below. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Extend edges according to information on common adjacent nodes. 
\item Select from 6 types of similarity measures, the results vary according to the type of similarity measure. 
\item The graph structure is stabilised by iterating data polishing cycles (converges at most times). 
\item Number of maximal cliques is reduced drastically when compared to the original graph. 
\item Maximal cliques are formed when the lower limit of degree of similarity decreases. 
\end{itemize}
