This command returns the difference between two general graph. 
However, as of this version, this command can be used to compare presence and absence of edge in undirected graph.  

\subsection{Format}
\begin{verbatim}
Format) mgdiff.rb i= f= m= [F=] [o=] [T=] [--help]

  Specify File Name 
  i= : File name of graph in edge data (node pair)
  f= : Field name of the 2 nodes in edge data
  m= : File name of reference graph (return the difference with this graph)
  F= : Field name of 2 nodes connected to the edge  in the reference file  (this parameter is not required if it is the same as f=)
  o= : Output file name
       Output the edge (node pair) from graph 1 data and graph 2 data based on the following values.  
        Field name: content
        i    :  file name specified at i=  if there is connected pair in the row 
       m    : file name specified at m= if there is connected pair in the row 
        diff : Classification of state
                1: only exist in graph specified at i=
                0: exist in graph in both i=,m=
               -1: only exist in graph specified at m=
  T= : Working directory (default:/tmp)
  --help : Help information
