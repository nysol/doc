############## Example 1
title="Basic Example"
comment=<<'EOF'
Use resemblance(sim=R) as similarity measure, the polished graph is obtained by extending the branch at th=0.4.
The number of polishing iterations are converged 3 times as shown in \verb|log1.csv| (iter,4)ã€‚
The output result is shown in Figure \ref{fig:resemblance04}.

############## Example 2
title="Polishing by PMI"
comment=<<'EOF'
Use normalized PMI(sim=P) as similarity measure, the polished graph is obtained by extending the branch at th=0.2.
The output result is shown in Figure \ref{fig:pmi02}.

############## Example 3
title="Polish once at intersection"
comment=<<'EOF'
Based on the explanation in the previous example. Use intersection(sim=T) as similarity measure, consider cases with 2 or more (th=2) branch extension with direct connection. Polish graph with 1 iteration (iter=1).
The output result is shown in Figure \ref{fig:polished2}.

############## Example 4
title="Exclude direct connection"
comment=<<'EOF'
When \verb|-indirect| is specified, direct connection is ignored when calculating degree of similarity.
The output graph is shown in Figure \ref{fig:polished1}, to remove all branches, branch data is not returned after polishing.
