# a. Multiplication of constants.
# Weight is attached to sum of products term x by the expression x*c, the weight
# of each term in x is multiplied by c times.
# The computation is similar to general polynomial.

 4 a + 8 b + 12 c

# b. Multiplication by 1 itemset
# Weight is attached to sum of products term y by the expression x*y,
# y is added to the weight of each term in x.
# However, note that the multiplication beteween same items is expressed as a*a=a.

> (4*x*a).show
 8 a b + 12 a c + 4 a

# c. Multiplication of 2 or more itemsets
# Multiplication of the sum of products x,y which is attached with weight is computed
# by the expression x*y,
# The operation enumerates all possible combinations on the two product terms.
# Like terms such as a,b itemset are multiplied.
# The resulting expression includes addition and subtraction operations between
# enumerated item sets.
